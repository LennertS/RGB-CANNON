# RGB-CANNON
A 2D shooter game made in Unity as submission to the 2018 Brackeys Game Jam.
This game forces you to obey the laws of additive color. To shoot the colored orbs, match the color with your RGB CANNON. The more orbs you can shoot down before one slips through, the more lumen you will collect.
This is my second project working with Unity and was made in 7 days.
Build for Windows

## Install instructions
The latest build can be downloaded from itch.io: https://jollyfellow.itch.io/rgb-cannon.
Unzip and run RGBCanon-v1.0.1-BUILD.exe.
This game is designed to be played on a resolution of 1920x1080. Playing this game on an aspect ratio other than 16:9 may result in a inferior game experience.

Enjoy the game!
